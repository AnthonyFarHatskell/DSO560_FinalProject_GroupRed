One suggestion I have for Apple Music is the ability to link two songs for shuffle. A lot of albums have songs that not only run into each other, but are necessary to play together. So when using your playlist on shuffle, some song transitions have no continuity and the flow is disturbed. Giving the end user the ability to decide whether or not they‚Äôd like to songs to play sequentially during shuffle would be a hit. Just make it to where two songs can be tied together. Once tied they will play together unless/until the user decides to disconnect them. I think it‚Äôll be swell.

It‚Äôs been at least two years at this point, from iOS 13 to iOS 15, where whenever I add a song to a playlist it‚Äôs a 50/50 shot it actually gets added or not. This is definitely a bug related to iCloud Music Library that needs to get worked out. Also, when queueing songs by selecting Play Next, there‚Äôs a 20% chance they don‚Äôt actually play next and are added a few songs down on the queue. And lastly, I wish I could delete songs from my library without also removing them from my playlists.

There are no real stand-out features separating it from the competition. Using it day-to-day it is easy to see the glaring flaws that keep it in second place. 

There is a song queueing system, but it isn‚Äôt practical in use. The way it is handed by competitors and by the Mac music app, where there is a play next and a play later and both are played before the rest of the playlist, is the ideal way to handle this feature. And when you do add music to up next or the library there‚Äôs a huge obstructive pop-up for each and every song. 

 Dolby Atmos is also overly hyped and mostly just a gimmick that does not improve the vast majority of songs. They sound better on stereo since that is how they were originally mixed. Maybe this will change in the future when songs are truly mixed in Amos, but for now the feature stays off for me. 

The real redeeming quality of Apple Music is its integration with iOS. It‚Äôs great to use with the Apple Watch and during workouts. The live album artwork is also gorgeous, but it doesn‚Äôt show up in the library tab!

2021-09-30 11:56:09,"Overall the app does its job at a very base level. As an Apple Music user, my biggest complaints are the lack of proper playlist syncing between my Mac and iPhone Pro‚Äôs, my ripped library versus Apple‚Äôs lossless versions, and a fully customizable equalizer (which is desperately needed for HomePod playback).

Playlists Sorting: 

Playlists can be sorted by title of track, artist, etc on my Mac Pro‚Äôs yet if I add a song on my iPhone to a playlist there is no option to ‚ÄúSort by‚Äù, leaving me to hold and drag each song individually to its place (usually I sort playlists alphabetically by song title). I can sort the newly added tracks that sync on my Mac Pro‚Äôs Music app in Big Sur but it doesn‚Äôt sort them on my iPhones with Apple Music. As a developer, many of us filed reports on this issue and not one has been recognized and addressed. Adding a simple ‚ÄúSort by‚Äù option in iOS Music shouldn‚Äôt be a difficult process as well as fixing the syncing issues with Apple Music playlists from Mac‚Äôs to iDevices. I‚Äôve lost countless hours manually arranging tracks I‚Äôve added on my iPhone and it never syncs up to my Mac Pro‚Äôs. 

The 15 second playback bug:

The infamous 15 second track playback stop randomly comes and goes (I‚Äôm using the latest iOS 15). Some lossless tracks simply stop playing 15 seconds into a song. This happened on my iPhone 11 Pro and now iPhone 13 Pro. Apple has publicly admitted the bug and claims to have remedied it yet occasionally it happens. I always download over Wi-Fi and make certain to check ‚ÄúLossless‚Äù audio over cellular (I have an unlimited plan), Wi-Fi, etc. Many times I‚Äôve had to delete a track and download it again which seems to be the only fix. When lossless audio was released users had to delete entire library downloads and force Apple Music to download the lossless and Dolby versions (your library will still have your song lists and playlists, this will simply clear out the downloaded versions on your iPhone). I plugged my iPhone in for power and opened Settings - Music - delete local, opened the Music app and selected the download all at the top of each playlist. Make sure you‚Äôre on Wi-Fi or it may not download the lossless and Dolby ATMOS versions. 

iTunes Match versus Apple Music lossless:

For those who used iTunes Match (which is essentially included in Apple Music), be aware that replacing any uploaded tracks with Apple Music tracks may actually be a downgrade. I have a few terabytes of CD‚Äôs I ripped in full quality on my systems years ago when digitizing my music collection and made sure each album was lossless (which adds up but at that time many codecs weren‚Äôt around that allowed for smaller file sizes without loss of audio quality). I used iTunes Match to upload a lot of my music with CD quality kbps bitrates. Apple Music replaced them with their lossless tracks which are not as good in quality (I believe 256 kbps is the standard). Trust me, there is a big difference when playing back on my McIntosh AVR and B&W sound system over AirPlay or using a DAC - even using my AirPod Pro‚Äôs which use standard Bluetooth that can‚Äôt carry such high bitrates my ripped tracks are far better than Apples lossless versions (I kept copies of both before diving into Apple Music‚Äôs lossless audio to compare). Keep a copy of your library before replacing it with Apple Music lossless and Dolby ATMOS versions especially as you will lose all those ‚Äúrented‚Äù tracks if you cancel your Apple Music subscription. Save your music on a backup drive. 

Equalizer:

I used to use another audio player on my iPhone which had a full customizable equalizer. It made an extremely noticeable difference and applied the saved equalizer evenly over each track - meaning if the bitrate/quality varied between tracks it would adjust in real time as to not distort the song. This would especially be useful on my OG HomePods which desperately need an equalizer. The preset options in Music settings are terrible. Unfortunately, many audio apps cannot playback Apple Music tracks due to licensing issues forcing me to use Apple‚Äôs native player.

1) Can‚Äôt download all. When migrating, you‚Äôd hope there‚Äôs a 1 click download all to offline listen for planes, places with spotty connection, etc. I found a workaround with my Mac by just shift clicking all the songs and moving them to a playlist, then 1-click downloading on my phone, but how hard can this be to add?

2) The queueing system. Wow, this one may make me switch back to Spotify. When I queue song A, B, C, D - it plays the songs in D, C, B, A order. In what world does that make sense? Someone with a song request at a gathering would get to ‚Äúcut the line‚Äù and play their song first? I know play later is there, but the app queues every song in your playlist and thus, renders the button useless. 

3) Unintuitive interface. Says it all, who knows to hold click in the app just to make a song go to the top? Even when it does go to the top to queue, it gets wiped by pretty much any action you take - closing the app, reshuffling.

2021-11-02 16:02:43,"I never write App Store reviews, but this app will be the first I do this for since I see great potential with Apple Music, but it has a long way to go from being perfect in my mind. There are plenty of positive things to say and plenty of negative things to say. I use both Spotify and Apple Music so I am coming to this review with an unbiased opinion and I want those who read this review to carry the same mind set so we can make Apple Music a better platform for all of us to enjoy.

Let‚Äôs start with positives‚Ä¶
1: Audio Quality: Lossless is a great experience to have when you have the right pair of headphones. There will be people who think they are getting the full experience with their AirPods but I hate to say it to those people‚Ä¶ you‚Äôre not. Get the right headphones and set up and it‚Äôs great but most people won‚Äôt notice it.

2: Social Features: I think Apple did a great job allowing people to see when people are listening to your playlist and having the ability to remove followers and take more control of their social presence. I found it nice.

3: Dark vs Light: Some of my friends prefer light mode so it‚Äôs nice that the choice is there for those people if they would rather have that. 

4: Now Playing Background: I absolutely love the glossy appearance the cover arts have when they are on this page, they look stunning in my eyes.

Now the negatives‚Ä¶
1: Social Features: Now I know I said this for positives but it can easily fall in negatives too. I miss Spotify‚Äôs Friends Tab where I can see what my friends listen to in real time and having follower counts and having that full social media like experience. Apple needs to improve this area and match it more with how Spotify does it.

2: Missing or Hard to get to buttons: Question, why is there no crossfade option on iOS in 2021? It is on the Android version and Mac version but not iOS. Enough said on that, but also why does Apple make it so difficult to like songs and hit shuffle when I want to shuffle my music? This needs fixed.

3: Continuity: Going from my iPad to my phone to my Mac is a pain with Apple Music. I cannot control my music from all my devices which is a big bummer. Spotify uses Spotify connect to make this feature happen and it‚Äôs seamless and awesome. Apple needs to implement a feature like this and I‚Äôm puzzled it isn‚Äôt already considering Apple is all about cross continuity.

4: Partners: To make this one short, Apple needs to partner with more speaker and hardware brands to put their app on so more cross compatibility is there. It‚Äôs already happening, but it is still a talking point for me.

5: UI: The interface on mobile is better as in its functional and ‚Äúeasier‚Äù to use but it‚Äôs still not a joy. Spotify is simple with 3 tabs on the bottom to choose and going through the experience is just smoother on Spotify due to better optimization. Apple Music on the computer is awful in every respect. It just looks old and the design changes based where you are. On playlists the songs lined up look better since you see cover arts and it looks neat. Then go to the songs tab and it looks like an old 2005 list of your songs from iTunes. The UI just needs much simpler ways to get around and make it easier to access song genres in browse instead of going to the very bottom.

6: Artist Following and New music: Apple please let us follow artists. Apple please let us have more control over our New Music playlist. Apple please make it better to find our new music where Spotify has their notification bell at the top and it tells you when new songs drop by your favorite artists. Either copy this or do something similar‚Ä¶ please. 

I feel this is a good starting point. I know there is much more I can say both for and against Apple Music. However, I am sticking to Spotify for now as it is a more polished experience throughout and Apple needs more time making Apple Music better. I think Apple needs to spend less time trying to make gimmicky features like Spatial Audio and Dolby Atmos and instead should work on the experience at its core rather than ignoring the problem by adding features barely anyone will use. Apple Music can be better and in some ways the only way to do that is for Apple to go back to the drawing board and make a much better user experience, but it has gotten far better over the years and we can all agree to that.",Apple Music: 2021 Update,MinimalistGuy,2,False,apple-music,1108187390

Apple Music does have its own unique algorithm that caters music to you, but it is highly dependent on the genre and artists you recently listened to on the current day, which can be tedious in my opinion, as depending on my mood affects what I want to listen to. I mostly use playlists catered to me because that‚Äôs how you get a more varied field of artists and music you haven‚Äôt heard of yet, which I tend to enjoy.

The iTunes legacy of ‚ÄúAdd to Library‚Äù vs. ‚ÄúLove‚Äù needs a serious overhaul. They are hidden behind a menu and hard to access. Plus, what exactly does it do to the recommendation algorithm when I add to library vs. ‚Äúlove‚Äù a song? Very unclear. In this regard, Spotify has a much simpler and easier to understand scheme of equating Loved content as your library. 

The other annoying thing is that every time you add a song, that incomplete album also shows up in your album view and adds clutter to your library. Again Spotify wins here: loved songs only show during ‚Äúsongs‚Äù view and loved albums don‚Äôt spam your songs list. 

The worst of all that made me switch to Spotify is probably the one thing that Apple Music should do well: music. It doesn‚Äôt understand music tastes. I had been using Apple Music for nearly four years and never liked 99% of its recommendations or Made for You playlists. I used Spotify for 1 month and I finally felt like it understood my tastes. 

Instead of adding Dolby Atmos/Lossless Playback that most people won‚Äôt be able to tell a difference, or animated album art gimmick, they should‚Äôve just put their engineering brains together to figure out how to fix their awful recommendation algorithm.

-Basic things like lacking a customizable Crossfade or customizable EQ especially take away from my experience. 

- The playlist curation seems to cater to what‚Äôs popular rather than accumulate music I might like 

- There are significant delays in streaming, and pausing songs. 

- I also think the app could use an appearance overall. Certain albums seem to get those special overhead covers, and others seem to just be left in the past. Even those albums that receive the overhead covers don‚Äôt react the same when accessed from your library. It‚Äôs just a weird inconsistency. If possible, give users the chance to customize their playlists in this way. 

-The artist pages seem especially biased towards certain artists. Artists like the Beatles, Elvis, Madonna receive special curation with up to 50 songs in their essential playlists, yet artists like Michael Jackson, Prince, Stevie Wonder (with similarly long if not longer careers) receive 25-30 essentials. I see far less bias here with apps like Tidal, Spotify, Deezer, etc. Apple Music needs either new curators or new curation methods that eliminate biases.

It has ~15 years of my listening history (carried over from iTunes) and fits neatly into the Apple ecosystem. And having Dolby Atmos on many songs is very cool (although spatial audio is increasingly less exclusive amongst the streaming services).

However, there are so many issues with the app and streaming catalog that its costs are starting to outweigh the benefits. Often when I play downloaded playlists in airplane mode (or with limited cell service), the entire playlist will just skip through. I can start an hour-long playlist and finish it in 5 seconds. More than once, I have attempted to play files from my library that suddenly and unexpectedly return the error ‚ÄúContent is not authorized‚Äù. Removing and re-adding such a song to my library usually solves this, but it also removes the song from all of my playlists! Playing songs in Lossless is so unreliable that I have turned it off entirely. I found that even ‚Äúdownloaded‚Äù playlists would play songs until the 15 second mark, then just hang until skipped. And streaming lossless songs takes several (5-7) seconds to buffer ‚Äî while this is not entirely unexpected due to the larger file size, it is still a pain and makes Lossless streaming more of a detraction than a feature.

2021-09-30 00:03:49,"I recently made the switch from Spotify to Apple Music because I want to be ""all in"" the Apple ecosystem. I was shocked to see how bad the Apple Music app is on both iOS and macOS. Here is why:

1) Library Management - This old style of managing the library doesn‚Äôt cut it on 2021. Adding a song to the library should only add it to the ‚ÄúSongs‚Äù part of the library. Adding an album to the library should only add it to the ‚ÄúAlbums‚Äù. Following an artist should add them to ‚ÄúArtists‚Äù. Please separate them like every other music streaming service. Right now everything is mixed together in one huge mess. Remove a song from your library, that song will get removed to ALL your playlists (why)? Want to download your whole library? Why isn‚Äôt there a ‚ÄúDownload All‚Äù button like on the other playlists?!
2) Sort & Search - The ability to search songs within playlists is missing. The ability to sort stuff out is missing everywhere. Please allow me to sort the songs in my playlists to ‚ÄúRecently Added (Descending)‚Äù where the recently added songs are at the top. Please allow me to sort playlists manually. Add a sorting option everywhere and make it consistent on all platforms. It‚Äôs super annoying. 
3) Playlist Management - We should be allowed to create playlist folders on mobile. We should be allowed to put Apple Music curated playlists to those folders (why isn‚Äôt this a thing?). We should be allowed to sort our playlists & folders ‚Äúmanually‚Äù the way we want. ‚ÄúRecently added/recently played‚Äù are too limiting if you have a huge number of curated playlists. On macOS the only way to sort them is Alphabetically. We should be able to pin playlists.
4) Optimization - Why does a music app need to take 1.5+ GB of RAM (in a 8GB M1 Macbook)? The native part of the app is optimized enough, but the parts which are web wrappers like ‚ÄúListen Now/Browse/Radio‚Äù are the culprit and they take way too much RAM. The website is super un-optimized even if I visit it from a browser. And a web wrapped app from Apple is unacceptable. Separate the web parts in smaller blocks and use API‚Äôs to fetch dynamic content, a web wrapper is just lazy and a bad experience. I am consistently scrolled all the way to the top (because the page is reloading) on my iPhone after switching tabs (and it drops frames like crazy).
5) Consistency - Web, macOS, iOS each have different features that are not consistent. For example on macOS I can sort the songs in my playlists to ‚ÄúRecently Added / Descending"" but not on iOS. On iOS I can sort the playlists in many ways but on macOS they‚Äôre sorted only Alphabetically. Library ‚ÄúSongs‚Äù look way different than other playlists on macOS. The whole service is a mashup of old iTunes, new Music & web wrapper. Why does the Android version allow you to use Chromecast but on Apple‚Äôs devices it‚Äôs limited to Airplay? Why does the Music account need to be tied to App Store account on iOS (please allow us to use a separate account just for music)? Why isn‚Äôt there an Apple Music app on TVs, Xbox, Playstation, Roku, Windows etc?

Conclusion: This service is the opposite of ‚Äúit just works‚Äù. I have a degree in Computer Science and I find myself searching things on the web to figure out how they work. This app is one of the worst experiences i‚Äôve had with Apple‚Äôs services and it‚Äôs absurd to me that these issues I‚Äôve reported haven‚Äôt been fixed for years. 

It‚Äôs a shame because Apple Music has the best curated playlists, radio shows, exclusive content and a bunch of goodies. The creative team is superb. The technical team though, they should be all fired imo. It‚Äôs like they don‚Äôt use their own app & it‚Äôs clear they‚Äôre not music lovers. From the poor technology choices to build the app, to the missing functions & features, it‚Äôs unacceptable. Not to mention slipping up bugs like lossless songs stopping at 15 seconds, and the weird white noise & lower volume on dolby atmos. The launch of both these important features got ruined by technological bugs.

I‚Äôm speculating the high subscription churn rate on this service is due to these problems. I don‚Äôt know if this a management problem or a incompetent developers problem but it should be fixed as soon as possible.

2021-09-23 17:42:25,"I‚Äôve been an Apple Music subscriber since December of 2019. One of the bugs in the app that still hasn‚Äôt been solved since iOS 13 or even iOS 12 is the ‚ÄúSyncing Your Library‚Äù banner at the top of the app when you turn on ‚ÄúSync Library‚Äù in the Music settings on my iPhone. Sometimes it will appear as if Apple Music has finished syncing my cloud library, essentially, and then I‚Äôll leave the app, and go back to it, and that banner that says, ‚ÄúSyncing Your Library‚Äù, will still be there, and it‚Äôs supposed to disappear after awhile and stay that way. And in my experience, this only happens on iOS. It doesn‚Äôt happen on my MacBook Pro when using the Apple Music app on my MBP laptop and I‚Äôm currently running macOS Big Sur 11.6. This has been a bug that‚Äôs been present in the Apple Music app on iOS since iOS 13, I believe. I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if that same banner appears on iPadOS, honestly. I don‚Äôt have an iPad, personally, but if it‚Äôs continuing to happen on iOS, I have no doubt in my mind that it is happening on iPadOS, as well.

The other gripe I have with the Apple Music app is that Apple offers 75 million songs to choose from and download to your phone or upload to your cloud music library, but you‚Äôre only allowed to have up to 100,000 songs in your cloud library. And of those 100,000 songs, if they‚Äôre matched and uploaded to your cloud library with files that you ripped from CDs or uploaded to your cloud library from elsewhere on the internet as free downloads from mega.nz/ or mediafire.com, those still count against Apple‚Äôs 100,000 song library limit, as well as any music uploaded to your cloud music library from the Apple Music catalogue. I‚Äôve read online that the only content that doesn‚Äôt count against this limit are songs purchased from the iTunes Store. 

Regarding the 100,000 song limit, I wish they would make it unlimited for those of us with large music libraries like me who has been collecting music since December of 2004 when I received my first iPod mini. 

 My suggestions for Apple would be to fix the ‚ÄúSyncing Your Library‚Äù bug on iOS/iPadOS and realize that they‚Äôll make people happy if they lift the 100,000 song limit for people with large music cloud libraries to unlimited. I know I would be happy if they did that, for sure. I would also suggest that Apple updates the Apple Music app every week like any other app in the App Store instead of only adding features and fixing bugs every time the iOS is updated each year. We shouldn‚Äôt have to wait a year for them to update the Apple Music app. They should be updating it constantly every week like every other app on the App Store. 

Another thing I would suggest that they do is to copy a page out of Spotify‚Äôs book and use an algorithm to recommend you new songs with their auto-play feature instead of using an actual human. That is one of the reasons why people love using Spotify is because their algorithm is so good at picking out new songs for you to listen to while auto-playing your music.

If I think of any other suggestions, I will update my review.

TL;DR Thanks for reading my review. I hope it was helpful and be sure to thumb up this review to let Apple know that it was helpful to you so that we can get Apple to read this and take my suggestions to improve upon the Apple Music app.",Bugs and suggestions to improve the app itself.,efishies15fivehundred,4,False,apple-music,1108187390
2021-09-29 19:01:33,"I literally CANNOT make a playlist with the new iOS update on my iPad. My iPad is brand new btw. Every time I make a playlist glitches and freezes and when I add songs they disappear. When I make a playlist the playlist doesn‚Äôt show up. 

Furthermore, when I skip songs sometimes it just freezes and I have to close the app.

Terrible UI with all these annoying bubbles everywhere, also why don‚Äôt I have a liked songs playlist?! Are you guys serious? What‚Äôs the point of ‚Äúlove‚Äùing a song if it doesn‚Äôt get added into a place where I can access it?

2021-09-29 17:19:06,"I don‚Äôt understand why library management continues to be such a frustration. I am constantly facing issues where albums are being split into two or more copies, and random compilations will appear in my library with songs I‚Äôve added to playlists, despite having ‚Äúadd playlist songs to library‚Äù turned off.

The main reason I prefer Apple Music to Spotify is the ability to have a true music library, but these issues make that beyond frustrating. 

Lastly, please do something with your Siri integration when trying to play music. I can‚Äôt tell you how many times I will ask for a specific song from an artist, however Apple Music will starts playing a random live version of that song.
