sassy4mp,"This is by far the best music app I have ever used. Easy to use. Easy to search and find songs. Super simple to create or add to a playlist... I have a playlist for my 3 yo son, one for our dog during thunderstorms...((It may not reeeally help her but it makes 𝘮𝘦 feel like I am helping soothe her)). I really can’t think of a downside to this app. Love it. We have the unlimited so any song is instantly there and available to download. Amazing. We did have just the reg FREE version for years bc I refused to buy the unlimited bc . . . It may be a few dollars but I just felt like WHY?! Tho, now having it the unlimited, I feel it is 𝙑𝙀𝙍𝙔 worth it. 
I am a music person so I wld have music playing 𝗅𝗈𝗎𝖽𝗅𝗒 in the house at alllll times if it didn’t drive the hubby nuts.

MsTiffany24,"I really like this app but I have tried an tried to find out why every time I get a phone call or I go out of my app when I push pause on my music an go back within minutes it goes an refreshes the whole app. I’m literally in the middle of a song so what is the purpose of refreshing the app 🧐I tried to just start putting the music on an old phone I have that’s just for WiFi but even that if I’m closer to it an pause it, you can’t leave the app longer then a minute it seems without it just thinking your not coming back or something. An the other issue is it constantly takes random music that i do listen to often out of my music list. I’ll add a song to my music an sometimes a playlist too, an I’ll be listening to the song randomly later on a station that I choose an I’ll go an decide to add it to a playlist an see that it’s not even in my music. So I’ll add it again. I’ve only notice it since like I said I’ll decide to add it to a playlist an see it has the plus next to add music. But why is it constantly coming out of my music. I have checked an seen that most songs still be in a playlist but not added to my music.. again not understanding these little things. But Please please fix.

Collectgirl,"This app is great, i've been using it for a couple of years now and I love it, it has all the songs I need, and I have yet to search a song that isn't on there (I have prime unlimited). However, lately i have been coming across songs that are extremely static and/or skip around to random parts of the song. For example, when i was listening to Jump, by Van Halen, after the first 40 seconds of the song it skips to around 1:50 of the song, and continues to skip around. It's very frustrating, and makes a terrible static sound when doing so. I've found that when i listen to these songs over my Echo Dot, this problem doesn't occur, it's only when I'm using my Airpods. I've never had this problem until recently, and it's only certain songs that do this, and it's pretty consistently happening. If i restart the app it fixes the problem temporarily, but it's a hassle, not to mention the static noise is terrible and is probably making me deaf. the songs i know of at the moment are Jump-van halen, paper sun-def leppard, bringing on the heartbreak- def leppard. I've only seen this glitch when i recently got into 80's music, and it's only the certain songs. i'm not sure if there are others, but these are the ones i know of. I've seen a problem with several def leppard songs. please fix this.",2021-03-05 12:17:08,Glitchy songs,False,4,amazon-music-songs-podcasts,510855668,
lou spuss,"Not a bad music app. Selection is good could be better. I’m with the others about the songs/artists “disappearing” without notice, it’s frustrating and makes me switch to a different app. I am a touch OCD so when I add a song to a named playlist and it doesn’t add into the overall library of “my music” I get frustrated. I too listen to music for 8-12 hours a day while working and commuting. Sometimes I would like to have the ability to shuffle every song in my library from all playlists, that is impossible with the current setup on the app. “My music” should be the cumulative collection of every song that has been downloaded or added to a playlist. Lastly, I should never hear the same song repeat itself day after day when in shuffle mode. Most days I will start my drive by hitting shuffle and I hear the same songs as the day before. This shouldn’t happen when I have hundreds of songs in each playlist an my music. It’s a simple program of “each song should only play once until all others have done the same” no matter how many times the app has been closed. I use the app because I can’t stand Top 40 stations; it’s like being mule kicked by a rhino. The app needs playback help, music selection is decent not great. If I had to pay for this without my prime subscription I would look elsewhere, the value is currently not there.",2020-12-09 13:41:05,Needs Garlic,False,3,amazon-music-songs-podcasts,510855668,
redres66334,"This is one of the most used app on my phone, especially when I’m with my kids or driving and I quickly need to play one of the kids favorite tracks, it’s super convenient to just say “Alexa play lullabies” or “Alexa play frozen songs”. However I hate that every time I open the app the first thing I get is a full screen ad for Music Unlimited with a giant buy button and a teeny-tiny text to skip. Such an infuriating dark pattern, especially when balancing a bawling kid on one hand and the fact that I have turned down the offer everyday for the last year should be indicative that I am not interested in buying. I already am a Prime member paying 130$ a year. If I wanted to pay for music I would get a subscriptIon that had a bigger collection, just saying. The second biggest irritation as many have mentioned is the constant disappearing of songs to the paid section. I am not sure what licensing changes are driving these but building up a library of playlists and then discovering that half of the songs don’t play anymore is really frustrating.   Apart from the above two, the app is good in general - does what it’s supposed to do, lyrics display is cool and is pretty stable and quick.

HillaryLaweeze,"I hate many things about this app, but the feature most bothersome to me of late is the keep listening feature.  The sleep timer is turned off, but every hour I get asked am I still listening to music.  Did I stop the music?! I have my device plugged in across the room because it’s not compatible with Legrand digital audio (fix this too!).  So, every hour when the music stops I have to go press keep listening.  I’m not opposed to exercise, but I’m trying to work, and this incessant disruption makes me want to pay for a different streaming music service.  This should only happen if I engaged the sleep timer.  This is a useless feature, especially if I am actually streaming on WiFi and have the stream only on WiFi feature engaged or am in offline mode listening to downloaded music.  Get rid of this.  Another huge annoyance is the amount of data this app uses even in data saver mode.   My daily commute (160 minutes total streaming time) uses 1 GB of data!  Maybe it would use less data if the lyrics feature could be disabled.

bunnbub54,"I just wanted to say that I LOVE LOVE LOVE music. I listen to music literally ever day. But there is one thing that really gets on my nerves. The music unlimited thing is a good idea but, some songs that I really like to listen to are music unlimited, and I LOVE to listen to Taylor Swift but, a few days ago when I tried to play it, it said that it was music unlimited. But maybe you could have like “pay 10$ for one week of music unlimited songs” or “Pay 20$ for a year” or something like that. You don’t have to that but it’s just a suggestion. 😊

Update: 
As I said before I love music and I like the music unlimited idea but it’s just kind of expensive and when I try to listen to certain songs sometimes the day after I listen to them they become music unlimited when we don’t pay for it in the first place. So I was thinking that the person wanting to listen to music but can’t because it is unlimited could pay, say, $20-$30 for a whole year or 1/2 a year of unlimited songs. I’m not trying to cut how much money you get I’m just throwing out some ideas that you could possibly look at and talk it over.

You have to pay a small amount of money for hundreds of good songs. Mostly any good song is in the unlimited music part. It’s really annoying. Anyway you pay a small amount but over time it becomes a lot of money. It’s really bothering wand I wish they would stop the unlimited music thingy. But even if they wanted to keep it maybe take off a chunk of songs so we can have good music.( Developers this might get you more customers!) but in truth is an okay app. I would say go ahead but be warned a lot of songs are restricted so it’s quite annoying. Me and my friends have been really bothered and have started to go to other apps. I can’t though because I have an awesome dad who is watching out for me and let’s me use this app but I’m starting to get to the point where I’d rather have no music than this app. It’s getting on my nerves.

Floody85,"I am currently subscribed to the unlimited and will be done with it for good after June is over. Short version; of you have prime then it’s included, great. Otherwise save your money.

 I like to listen to stations as it gives me a better variety; first off the variety of similar artists was soo off pace for the first few days I was pressing thumbs down more than I was anything else. These were stations I created and couldn’t believe there were algorithms out there saying they were similar artists, furthermore it would continually throw the same artists I thumbed down MULTIPLE Times in there with different songs that weren’t any better. Secondly and possibly even more frustrating is that when I paused a song and then would go to press play on that song 5-10 minutes later I would just get the “loading song” description and that’s it. I would then need to skip or push to the next song ,then press play again in order for it to start playing music. Lastly if I searched an artist and then created a station off of that artist I would notice that if paused that station and then resumed within 5-10 minutes it wouldn’t resume on the station it would resume on most previously searched artist.. free pandora is a better choice than the current state",2019-06-06 01:50:47,Possibly the most frustrating music app,False,1,amazon-music-songs-podcasts,510855668,
Shaolins Own,"I’m subscribed to the unlimited edition (as well as a prime obv) where I paid for the year upfront for all the music you got. I’ve been using your app for about a year so far.

You’re UI is solid, but there is so much clutter and overlap in your content/songs it makes the overall experience when searching for specific versions of an artists recordings stressful. You will find the same song on 9 different versions of albums some of which are legit and should be “duplicates” but it’s just your orchestration and layout is sloppy. I think using release date of said album for example as an organization method would be a really simple way to manipulate the data so it’s not so messy looking. Take Frank Sinatra’s artist results for example. When scrolling through the albums available, it’s all over the place. One of his major albums is like 7 or 8 rows down in the search results, while other single song albums or various versions are scattered in between and all over.

Organize the results on your UI and I think it might be 4.5 star material. You lose a half star because while content is there in some way the price point is high for already prime subs.",2019-01-01 23:02:42,I like but let’s talk,False,3,amazon-music-songs-podcasts,510855668,

The problem I have, though, is that lately it has been stopping at irregular intervals and asking if im still listening. I have one particular playlist that is used to get me through medical infusions. I get my IV started and listen to my playlist. I know where I am in the infusion by the song playing. No need to keep pulling out my phone or looking for a clock. My last infusion was interrupted by the “Are you still listening “ thing. I had my phone in my purse across the room. I couldn’t get to it and was left with nothing. Music gets me through these infusions and not having it on  was distressing. If im not listening to it, I will stop it on my own. Considering just buying the songs from iTunes and staying uninterrupted. This hasn’t been an issue until just recently but looking online I see other people have been experiencing it for a long time.

SaViSe,"I love this app. For the most part. The available selection of music is HUGE, although there are some artists and/or albums I wish were available with out paying for Music Unlimited (I’m looking at you, Led Zeppelin!). I was EXTREMELY excited to see the new update, which added volume normalizing, which was easily my biggest complaint, since shuffling music meant constantly adjusting my phone/car’s volume from song to song. What I didn’t realize, however, was that I was going to have to re-download EVERY SINGLE SONG on my phone. I have about 7000 songs downloaded. I’m in the middle of my second day of re-downloading. It’s excruciatingly slow, even with a very fast connection, and, unless you leave the app open, constantly gets hung up or frozen, meaning you have to restart the downloads (you don’t lose what you’ve already done, thank god!).

Any “user friendly” interface is easy to discern to the point where it becomes almost intuitive.

On the plus side, when the music is playing the sound quality is amazing and has true fidelity I believe as to how the artist intended it to sound!

kelsarro,"Overall the app is decent. I have been able to discover a lot of new artists and songs that I enjoy from the artist radios and suggestions. Here are my cons:
Artist radios.. I have avoided thumbs-upping any songs that I like. I have found that when I do, it will play those songs that I thumbs-upped first every single time I play that particular radio. I guess that’s the point but I end up hating the song because it becomes way overplayed. Which is kind of how Pandora’s radio is. It’s just annoying. So don’t thumbs up anything unless you want to eventually hate it.

Shuffle on My Music.. needs some improvement. It seems like the algorithm needs work or something because it will shuffle and play THE SAME SONGS and then there are songs that I will never ever hear. I end up removing songs from My Music just because the shuffle seems to love playing it. I end up letting it play alphabetically just so I can hear my other songs. That’s terrible!

I can’t deny that it is extremely useful and easy to use— and is ideal for anyone who likes to listen to music on the go— however, after updating to the most recent version of the app, I have found that after a mandatory refresh, all my music was GONE! I had downloaded well over 3,000 songs (as an Unlimited subscriber) and was very disappointed to find all that gone. Not only that, but every thirty seconds the app crashes and restarts— making it to where it would be virtually impossible to re-download all those missing songs unless I had god-speed wifi, which, I regret to inform you, I do not have.

That worked for a while as I never get tired of my favorite songs, but I wanted to explore more music. So I went to stations that were different than ""today's hits"" and had major nostalgia! Beatles, Beach Boys, 80's, 90's, and the best of the recent decade were filled with songs we remember but haven't heard for a while.

Mta5,"Hard to separate the app from the service...you are going to get both here. I have been an unlimited subscriber for more than year. I made the jump because I enjoyed the music, the sound quality is good and the library is enormous. Yes the better content requires you to pay and I’m surprised that people are surprised by that. Though, having artists leave the free version without any sort of warning was annoying. Again, part of the reason for the switch. If you like the service, pay to support it. Makes sense.

The app has been buggy for me in past versions. It tended to just restart itself. I’d say maybe the device, but this was the only app that did it. The latest update seems to have corrected the issue. The UI is decent, not fantastic but decent. 

The auto play feature they added is annoying. I get why it would seem like a good idea...if you play one song it stops. That bothered me at first, but once you realize you told it to play one song and it did exactly what you told it to, the frustration fades. If you want continual play, start a station or playlist. Nothing like playing a song that you know is okay for your 4 year old to hear and then have auto play throw on another song from the genre that absolutely is not. Good thing you can turn that off.

Keeping this name anonymous,"I love this app. I’ll say that first. It has all of my favorite artists, and such a large selection of songs/albums. I can download music, create playlists, all the things I need for a streaming service. 

However, this app isn’t without its flaws. Sometimes you can’t go back to a certain part without starting the song over. If you pause a song and start it again it might stop making sound but look like it’s still playing. (It’s not, pause it and it fixes itself.) The app crashes a lot, mostly if you’re not in the app at the moment. That’s the most frustrating of all of them, as it starts whatever song you were playing over. (But not the album, play queue or playlist. It will shut down radio stations, however.) 

I’d like to mention that I saw a review saying you couldn’t make play queues or play a single song on loop. This is not the case. I don’t know if that was a patch or something, but I’ve always been able to play one song on loop. Perhaps it’s a difference between phone models, but I’m on a 6 and it works just fine. I don’t see why it wouldn’t on later phones.

I’ll listen to Christmas music one day, and Christian or classical or EDM another day. Every time I change it, all I see suggested is music from the last genre I listened to.

Ability to sort the song orders on the playlists I create. Always having the first song I put on the playlist is not ideal. I would prefer to have the last song added on the top and the first song added on the bottom, that way I hear the newest music first. Other sort filters could include sort by number of times played, release date, and of course date added.

The medium:  some of the ultra-HD of old classic rock has been remixed. In some cases this is good when some bass has been added back in that wasn’t possible in the original due to the dynamic range limitations of vinyl.  In some cases the bass is a little over done, but still probably a little better than the original. In other mixes, it just doesn’t sound quite right, since the original art was the product of the musicians and the mixers at the time. When this happens, the feel is similar to watching a colorized veesion of a classic black-and-white film.

However, there are 2 downfalls:
1. The music stops if more than one device is playing. It didn’t do this before and it’s very frustrating.
2. They are obnoxiously persistent in trying to push their more expensive unlimited version. Often they will obstruct the ability to go directly to Prime Music—instead, making you opt out of the higher cost unlimited version. Several times, when I opted out of the unlimited, instead of directing me to Prime  Music it would just take me back to the previous screen.  I’ve been a Prime member for several years and it started doing this a few months ago. Prime Music is not a free service. There is a monthly fee.

Katy kate,I’ve been using this app for several years and I appreciated the free music since there are quite a few music apps that are very expensive to use and I hate the radio. However over the last six months the app has started to constantly have a static in the middle of the songs that borderline blow out my speaker or my eardrum. I never know when I’m unexpectedly going to have to shift over to a new song because the current one will no longer play. This started out to be extremely rare but has now become more and more frequent. I also really do not like the new CarPlay mode being the default mode when you start the app and having to exit in order to have actual control of what I want to listen to. I just did the most recent update hoping it would’ve fixed at least the static issue but unfortunately it doesn’t look like it has so I will be forced to find a different music app.,2021-05-21 12:41:46,Getting worse each update,False,2,amazon-music-songs-podcasts,510855668,

Your recently added music rolls off the list after a certain period of time even if you are not adding any new songs. This is fine but I would still like to see my song history sorted by recently added. If you do not turn these into a playlist they roll off and are difficult to track down across your library especially as your recently played list is muddied when you have users across your household playing songs from multiple Alexa devices vs. what I may have played independently on my iPhone app. DEV/Product manager please add the capability to sort songs by date added to your library and perhaps song history by device.,2020-07-16 20:48:44,Great app,False,5,amazon-music-songs-podcasts,510855668,

Good station setups and it’s easy to use and includes the normal music app stuff like playlists/personalized stations etc. only have 2 issues, the first is that it doesn’t function as well with Alexa/alexa speakers as I would like in that it will be slow to load what the speaker is playing in the app on my phone/not load it at all/not allow me to like songs at times, just generally not communicate well. The second is that the “my soundtrack” station is great, and my most used, but not as random as I would like, rather than play songs at random from all the liked songs/genres you have it will go in waves of hip hop songs for a while then pop for a while then metal for a while etc. not a legit shuffle situation.

CJBPM,"Look, the offering for the contemporary music is fine, but I listen to much more.  There are barely any offerings for Sibelius or Charles Ives (even compared to other services).  Jazz offerings are abysmal, and the sound quality is very poor.

There are times when I type in an artist, an album I am searching for will not appear, but if I type in the album name exactly (by itself) it will appear at the bottom of the list.

There are no “liner notes” with albums or other information.  Nothing to tell you about the conductor or even the YEAR it was recorded (nor the quality of the recording).  I am doing the $1.99 four month deal... but I am not likely to continue unless the offerings get better.

That being said, the My Soundtrack station is very good. I would miss that feature since it mixes various genres and does a good job of knowing what music I like.

Update:  I am a bit annoyed  now by My Soundtrack... it plays the same songs over and over (and over) again.

More to hate:  Opera offerings are incredibly old and poor quality recording.  The interface is greatly flawed.  I use it in landscape mode on an ipad (using Smart Keyboard)— when viewing an album it is mostly covered.  Often the controls don’t work and have to be hit multiple times.

it doesn’t even work well with echo speakers...

Honestly I find that just about the same music plays when you choose any station, and there’s no real good variety or way to shuffle across genres. Playlists are the same as the free edition too. Adding songs or albums is not intuitive as well, where many times the entire album is added versus just the song you want or if a song belongs to an album have fun deleting it. The idea is great to be able to play just about any song, but most of the time you just want to shuffle or play a station with good variety and that adapts to your taste.

So... I have an AppleTV hooked up to a very nice Atmos-capable receiver and speakers. Amazon’s AppleTV music app doesn’t indicate anywhere which formats tracks and albums are, even though the iPhone app does. Even though some of these are in Atmos surround format and my AppleTV and sound system will play those, Amazon’s app only sends out a stereo signal. They only enable Atmos music on their own version of a HomePod. 

I previously tried and canceled Tidal because their app actually will play Atmos formatted music on AppleTV, but the app itself was absolutely useless. Amazon’s isn’t turning out to be much better. 

Eventually, Apple Music will offer high-res and surround music formats, and they’ll probably do it right, so that you can find exactly what music you’re looking for and know which format it is.

Pros:
- The app is very stable and never crashes.
-Music selection is good and like that lyrics are available for many songs to sing along with.
- Can download songs and entire Playlist of songs so you can listen anywhere. 
- I  uninstalled iTunes and it works fine without it and stores files on my phone. I am not interested in iTunes so this is good alternative.

Cons:
- This app is very confusing to use. It may look elegant but the user interface is not intuitive at all. Items are buried several clicks away.  A little bit here, a little bit there.
- Tiny controls and icons make it even more frustrating to use during a workout. Some of us would just like a easy to read word instead of a tiny icon.
- No radio stations that I'm aware of, only a limited selection of preset playlists.
- No way to know if the exact song you are listening to is one you already bought already.
- Realize that the music that's included with Prime for no extra cost consists of many alternate recordings asks not the exact version that you're accustomed to hearing.

Frustrated Trucker1753,Very unsatisfied. Got roped in when it was first introduced and included in my Prime membership. Me and my wife and 2 children created playlists and were enjoying it and then overnight 80% of our songs were no longer available. That’s when Unlimited was introduced. We then enrolled in Unlimited for an extra fee and began enjoying it again and then only one of us could stream at a time when before we had all been able to. We called thinking something might be wrong on our end but we’re then told it would be another $40/month for all of us to stream at once. SMDH. We are cancelling Prime and Unlimited as soon as our year is up and switching to Apple Music and Ebay. Very disappointed in amazons greed.

Davis Lane,"Overall this app works well if you are streaming your music. In fact, I’d say that it’s easily a 5-star app if that’s the only function you want to use. Where it drops to 3-stars is the difficulty of managing downloaded music. Inexplicably, there is no tab for managing downloaded songs in an efficient or convenient manner.

If you manage to actually find the offload function, you have to manually repeat the process for every single piece of music you wish to remove from your device. There is no bulk selection function. You have to do it all individually.

This is a glaring oversight and I can see it infuriating anyone who may want to modify a varied playlist of any substantial size. It should be as easy to delete songs as it is to download them.

I love the family plan....but the way they catalog artists and genres is painful. 

*update* issues continue. I went to an artist page and downloaded top songs. Those songs show on my phone and on the desktop app as “unknown artist”.

There are 2 separate artists for “Nitty Gritty Dirt Band” and “THE Nitty Gritty Dirt Band”. Same with many artists.  A collaboration shows as a completely different artist vs. keeping the artist listed as whomever released the song. A song off a plague vendor album shows “unknown artist”, yet is on their album - how is this even possible?

Songs and albums randomly disappear if there is a remaster or “new” version, so you need to find and delete and redownload all that you had. It is confusing and time consuming.

The band Dillinger escape plan shows in multiple genres - even songs from the same album. Tool’s song fear Inoculum shows as genre “modern metal”, but is the only song from that album classified as such.

I try to use genres to create playlists since the way artists are listed is so inconsistent, but there are inconsistencies all over the place.

1)After creating a new playlist or entering multiple songs to one already created, could there be an option to ‘save to same playlist’? It would save a lot of scrolling ie after discovering some new songs by the same artist/genre.
2)Could there be an alphabetical choice at the top of the playlist view so one could access a playlist faster?
3)A way to highlight songs within a playlist eg: so as not to have to delete one song at a time or be able to copy/paste quickly to another playlist",2020-11-10 03:20:10,Really Enjoy but could use organizational fixes,False,4,amazon-music-songs-podcasts,510855668,

Cons:   Hard to simply find exactly what you want to hear again without stepping over a lot of visual clutter of what you scrolled through no matter how lightly before.

Lots of re-recordings of older popular hit makers singing with their modern day present voices and not very good studio musicians.   Badfinger is a good example.

Duskfeather,"I’m not someone who usually leaves reviews, let alone bad ones.

I usually play by artist, using that feature to play through *all* of their albums with no fiddling around or fuss. This latest update though, has made that option impossible. It used to be that selecting the artist would show all of the songs, grouped by album, and you could select the song you wanted to start one, and it would loop all through the albums with no issue.

No longer. Playing from the albums themselves works, thank the stars for small miracles. But any attempts to bypass the large play button that forces you to start from the album closest to the beginning of the alphabet fail. Looking at all of the songs and selecting one only plays *that one song*, even when repeat is shut off. So currently, the only way to listen to all of an artist’s songs and start from a different song than the “first” one means using the play button, and skipping until you hit the song from the album you actually want.

I don’t know who designed this update, but they need to bring back at least part of the old play by artists design. Because this one is too clunky to actually be functional.",2021-11-25 20:21:28,"Could be good, latest update a huge miss tho",False,1,amazon-music-songs-podcasts,510855668,

Quick Summary:
-Audio Quality is great when Ultra HD is available (1st reason I use it)
-Works with Alexa devices (2nd reason I use it)
-Buffer Times seem to be quite long even when on speedy WiFi (more to it than internet speed); there are plenty of times that I have been playing music for a group of people and music stops between switching songs because of loading

-App crashes at least weekly 
-Top Charts and Playlists aren’t the best curated

If you get your category tagging right and the app can consistently bring the user to the spot where they were before visiting an album page where the individual songs are located, you will have a world class app.

Concerning the tagging, it is a total mess. If you have hundreds of albums there is no way to view the albums that reside within a specific genre. Also the assigning of albums to categories is almost arbitrary, not to mention there are sometimes multiple sub-categories that divide up a larger category. Concerning this latter, I am not opposed to this, but both the containing category and it’s component piece sub-categories have to make sense and applied completely throughout that genre and sub-genres.

Craig702,The app was at least 4.5 stars in the beginning but has gotten less appealing with each upgrade. They took away the ability to play my other music on my phone with no way to import the music I already had on the phone. So now I have to use 2 separate app’s to play all my music. Now they removed the Recommended tab so it’s harder to discover new music and artists similar to my taste I might like.  There is a “Albums Just for You” but mostly recommends music I already have. Really liked the “Recommend” feature. It also appears that newly released songs and albums are only updated once a month or so.

Cons: The unlimited is rather expensive for having so many bugs in it. If you pause a song too long the app will kick you out of the station you are listening to. Sometimes the song and artist are titled wrong for the song that is actually playing.

Eideard,"Miles, Mingus and Monk come with me on my morning walks.  Know how good that feels?  Growing up in a New England factory town, I used to hop on the A Train down to Harlem, down to the Village, down to the lower East Side, West Side of NYC, catch Miles, Mingus and Monk live.  Birdland, The Five Spot, The Half Note, starting in 1956.

Leave my factory slaving, meet my brol at the train station and we'd be at Birdland by 9 o'clock.  Roamed the great music living in the city at that time - and in my life for the rest of time.

Issues I’m not happy with. First and foremost the app constantly crashes or goes into “offline mode” which requires me to close and restart the app. This happens quite frequently. 

Secondly, the lack of ability to save “favorite radio stations” is annoying. In pandora you can have a list of your favorite stations based on genre/song/artist etc. Not on prime. 

Thirdly, liking a song on “my soundtrack” just means you’re going to hear more songs you’ve already liked, not new or similar music. And god forbid you like a song from multiple genres. Your “soundtrack” will now play all kinds of music instead of one type in particular (see above favorite radio stations).

Adding the ‘Unlimited’ package expands the library into new/special release territory and added features such as music videos and turns off the extended streaming ‘are you still here/keep listening’ prompt.

The 'stations' portion is great, too. Many times it’s nice to just set a station, and let the AI choose the playlist and order. I’ve discovered artists I’ve never heard before and have been able to expand into their catalog, simply from the AI playing a song in the station.

(3) edit that queue to change the order of songs or even remove some of them.
(4) save that queue as a playlist

Briefly:

• Routinely gets stuck in a state where the player freezes. You’re stuck trying several things to get it to play again - reboot app, switch signal types (wifi, cellular). I thought maybe it was just my phone but after upgrading hardware, still experienced the same issues.

• Could do a better job remembering where you left off in your song or playlist. You’re often left “starting over,” looking for that song or playlist manually.

Pros:

•Stores music on the device and plays these audio clips with high fidelity

•Beautiful and intuitive menu systems

Cons:

•Most music is locked behind a pay wall

•Will not stay in offline mode in any circumstance

•Will forcibly turn itself from offline to online mode at random when you do not have wifi or a cell signal, which halts the music

•Obnoxious advertisements with small close buttons squeezed next to massive ""Give me money"" buttons

•Inefficient file storage method

- seems like its trying to provide too much (lyrics, album art, etc) so just loading a track list takes longer
- wayyyyyy too many songs removed from albums or only not so popular albums available
- band singles shouldn't be in the album section
- if you pause and go to another app be prepared to reload when you come back

But I wish:
1. That you could give songs ratings (1-5 stars) So that you can play only your 4 or 5 star picks on shuffle, instead of shuffle playing everything including the not so favorites. 
And 
2. When you download Christmas or Seasonal music but it’s not time to “‘tis” the season, you can store your holiday music on the side so it doesn’t come up on your shuffle mix during a Fourth of July party!

Doodaddy,"It’s like they took all the negative feedback from every other streaming music app, then based their app on that.

* Playlists? Sort of. You can’t set any kind of rule-based smart playlist (“hip hop that I’ve rated 3 stars and haven’t heard in a month”). You can make lists of songs, but that’s it. 

* UI? Oh my, it’s bad. Dark grey on black, first of all — is that supposed to be hip? It’s just illegible half the time. 

* Import playlists from Apple Music? Nope. They’ll claim they can, but it doesn’t work.
