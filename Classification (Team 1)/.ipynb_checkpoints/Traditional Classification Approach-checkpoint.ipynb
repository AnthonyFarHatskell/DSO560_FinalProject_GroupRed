       " ' i just want to say that i love love love music . i listen to music liter ever day . but there is one thing that realli get on my nerv . the music unlimit thing is a good idea but , some song that i realli like to listen to are music unlimit , and i love to listen to taylor swift but , a few day ago when i tri to play it , it said that it wa music unlimit . but mayb you could have like “ pay 10 $ for one week of music unlimit song ” or “ pay 20 $ for a year ” or someth like that . you don ’ t have to that but it ’ s just a suggest . 😊 updat : as i said befor i love music and i like the music unlimit idea but it ’ s just kind of expens and when i tri to listen to certain song sometim the day after i listen to them they becom music unlimit when we don ’ t pay for it in the first place . so i wa think that the person want to listen to music but can ’ t becaus it is unlimit could pay , say , $ 20- $ 30 for a whole year or 1/2 a year of unlimit song . i ’ m not tri to cut how much money you get i ’ m just throw out some idea that you could possibl look at and talk it over . i hope that these idea come to be use in the futur .']"
